# CS-330-T4214-Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization-23EW4

In this project I learned to manipulate objects to recreate real world items. One example is a jar I had in my scene in where I combined a cylinder and torus. By iterating my scene many times i was able to get a better understand of the placement of the objects. The first object I created was placed at 0,0 however when more objects were added i had to know how to position them on the plane so they were not close together. My approach when it comes to developing code has improved greatly which each milestone. I organized my code in a way that allowed me to easily add and remove objects. 

Computer graphics and visualisation knowledge allows me to be a better programmer. It helped me create cleaner code and improved the readability of it by adding comments. As of right now I am unsure if I may use computer graphics in my future professional pathway but when the times comes I will at least have one experience of creating 3d objects.
